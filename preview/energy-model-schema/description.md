# Pagination

The Pollination API provides several data intensive information. In order to keep our
servers happy, the API will automatically paginate the requested items. *It's important
to form calls with [Link header](#section/Pagination/Link-header) values instead of
constructing your own URLs.*

## Link header

The Link header includes pagination information. This is an example for model faces which
includes next and last page. Pollination uses same convention as GitHub API

```
Link: <https://api.pollination.cloud/<model-id>/faces?page=2&per_page=50>; rel="next",
<https://api.pollination.cloud/<model-id>/faces?page=50&per_page=50>; rel="last"
```

This Link response header contains one or more Hypermedia link relations. The possible
`rel` values are:


| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `next` | The link relation for the immediate next page of results. |
| `last` | The link relation for the last page of results. |
| `first` | The link relation for the first page of results. |
| `prev` | The link relation for the immediate previous page of results. |
