properties:
  face_type:
    description: |
      Optional input for surface type. 0.0 = Wall, 1 = Roof, 2 = Floor,
      3 = Ceiling, 4 = AirWall, 5 = Window

    type: string
    pattern: "^[.A-Za-z0-9_-]*$"
  vertices:
    description: |
      A collection of integers to reference the index of vertices in
      vertices.
    type: array
    items:
      type: integer
      minItems: 3
    example: [0, 10, 5, 3]
  vertices_ext:
    description: Extended list of indexes for vertices which includes child faces like
      windows. This list should be flattened and include the corner vertices. This is
      also known as face profile. For radiance model vertices_ext will be checked first
      and vertices will be used only if vertices_ext is not provided.

    items:
      type: integer
      minItems: 8
  rad_modifier:
    description: |
      Index of radiance modifier in radiance_modifiers. This modifier will be used as
      default material for this face. See rad_modifier_direct for optional modifier for
      direct studies. If empty the modifier will be assigned based on face type.
    type: integer
  rad_modifier_dir:
    description: Index of radiance modifier for direct sunlight calculation in
      model.rad_modifiers. Default is blacked rad_modifier.
