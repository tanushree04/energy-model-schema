        description: |
          A model that will be used for direct studies. This model will be used in
          solar-access studies. Direct sunlight calculation in 2-Phase (2nd phase) and
          5-phase (5th phase). If you are using a BSDF material for direct studies it
          should be a high-resolution (e.g. tensortree) BSDF.

        description: |
          Blacked out representation of this model. Blacked model will be used in studies
          with multiple dynamic apertures to remove the contribution of light from this
          aperture when the contribution from another aperture is being calculated.

          A glowed representation of the model for inward matrix calculations.
          In most cases inward matrix calculation is referred to as view matrix.
