      vertices:
        description: |
          A collection of integers to reference the index of vertices in
          vertices.

      rad_modifier:
        description: |
          Index of radiance modifier in radiance_modifiers. This modifier will be used as
          default material for this face. See rad_modifier_direct for optional modifier for
          direct studies. If empty the modifier will be assigned based on face type.
        type: integer
      rad_modifier_dir:
        description: Index of radiance modifier for direct sunlight calculation in
          model.rad_modifiers. Default is blacked rad_modifier.
        type: integer
      ep_construction:
        description: Index of energy construction in model.ep_constructions.
        type: integer
      is_aperture:
        description: |
          A boolean that indicates if this Face is an aperture. An
          aperture can see the source of light (sky or sun) directly.
          For interior windows this value will be False. Non-aperture openings won't be
          considered as a separate source of light in calculation and will be treated
          as go-through windows.
        type: boolean
