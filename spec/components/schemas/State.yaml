  State for a dynamic model. Most of the time a dynamic model is an apertures (window
  group).
type: object
required:
  - count
  - model
properties:
  name:
    description: A unique name for this state.
    type: string
  count:
    description: The count for this state.
    type: integer
    minimum: 0
  is_aperture:
    description: |
      A boolean that indicates if this state represents an aperture in building. An
      aperture can see the source of light (sky or sun) directly. For interior windows
      this value will be False. Non-aperture openings won't be considered as a separate
      source of light in calculation and will be treated as go-through windows.
    type: boolean
    default: true

    type: object
    required:
      - default
    properties:
      default:
        description: |
          Default model to be used for normal raytracing recipes.
        type: StaticModel
      direct:
        description: |
          A model that will be used for direct studies. This model will be used in
          solar-access studies. Direct sunlight calculation in 2-Phase (2nd phase) and
          5-phase (5th phase). If you are using a BSDF material for direct studies it
          should be a high-resolution (e.g. tensortree) BSDF. 
        type: StaticModel
      black:
        description: |
          Blacked out representation of this model. Blacked model will be used in studies
          with multiple dynamic apertures to remove the contribution of light from this
          aperture when the contribution from another aperture is being calculated.
        type: StaticModel
      tmtx:
        description: |
          Transmission matrix. A BSDF representation of the model for matrix-based
          calculations. This model will be used in matrix multiplication.
        type: StaticModel
      inmtx:
        description: |
          A glowed representation of the model for inward matrix calculations.
          In most cases inward matrix calculation is referred to as view matrix.
        type: StaticModel
      outmtx:
        description: |
          A blacked out representation of the model for outwards matrix
          calculations. outwards matrix calculation in most cases are referred to as
          daylight matrix.
        type: StaticModel
